Scripts used in the article "Synthetic Promoter Designs Enabled by a Comprehensive Analysis of Plant Core Promoters" (link to article)

The folder 'analysis' contains the R code to process the raw subassembly and barcode count files and generate the data for the figures.

The folder 'barcode_extraction' contains the bash script to extract and count barcodes from seqeuncing read files.

The folder 'CNN' contains the Python code to train convolutional neural network models and use them for the *in silico* evolution.

The folder 'data' contains data required for the analysis (including the promoter annotation and the raw subassembly and barcode count files).

The folder 'figures' contains the LaTeX code to generate the figures of the article.

The folder 'promoter_annotation' contains the code to extract promoter sequences from the Arabidopsis, maize and sorghum genomes.

The folder 'subassembly' contains the code to link barcodes to the corresponding promoters.
